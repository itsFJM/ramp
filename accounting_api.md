# Accounting

The Accounting API provides endpoints for managing chart of accounts data, including custom fields, field options, general ledger accounts, and vendors. Most endpoints support batch operations with limits per API call (typically 500 items). You can make multiple API calls to upload more than the per-call limit. For complete guidance, refer to the Accounting Guide.
